# Nathan-Kim-Portfolio


**Nathan Kim Personal Portfolio**

Hello, my name is Nathan Kim, and I am a Statistics and Data Science Major at UCLA. I am a fourth year transfer student and am looking forward to earning my Bachelor Degree in Spring 2024. I am passionate in applying data analytics to sports and identifying data trends from player comparisons. I utilized statistical analysis and graphical models in R to support my analysis and discussed my findings in research papers found in the UCLA Bruin Sports Analytics Club [link](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/blog). 

I have also utilized my sports data analytics experience for working in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as as data analyst intern in Summer 2023. I am currently conducting a project correlating 911 outage cases with companies' certification records. 

This repository is to display my skills and data science/data analytics projects.
